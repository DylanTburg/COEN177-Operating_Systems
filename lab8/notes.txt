Title: Lab8 - Memory Management Notes

1. For step one I just took the example code snippet and defined values for numRequests and possiblePages.

2. For steps 2-3, I just made code that read from testInput and printed the cache misses. Because the instructions 
   directed me to treat all values as cache misses, all numbers in testInput were printed regardless of cache size 
   (we don't have cache yet)
   
3. Everything else in writeup
